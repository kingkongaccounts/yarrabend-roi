							<p>Personal information means information or an opinion, whether true or not and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual who is identified or reasonably identifiable. </p>
							<h3>1.3	OUR OBLIGATIONS</h3>
							<p>We are required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPS) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act).  The APPs regulate the manner in which personal information is handled throughout its life cycle, from collection to use and disclosure, security, accessibility and disposal.</p>
							<p>We are also required to comply with more specific privacy legislation in some circumstances, such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>applicable State and Territory health privacy legislation (including the Victorian Health Records Act ) when we collect and handle health information in the relevant jurisdiction; and</li>
								<li>the Spam Act and the Do Not Call Register Act.  </li>
							</ul>
							<h2>2.	WHAT WE COLLECT</h2>
							<h3>2.1	GENERAL</h3>
							<p>The type of personal information that we collect about you depends on the type of dealings you have with us.  For example, if you:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>are a purchaser or a prospective purchaser of a property – we will collect your name, age, address, contact details, details of the property that you are interested in or have agreed to purchase (such as the location and size of the property and the design and specifications of the apartment), what prompted you to inspect the project, how you heard about us, details of price points and property/apartment types you are interested in (for example house and land packages, townhouses, apartments - one bedroom or two bedroom) and whether you are an owner-occupier or investor.  If you are purchasing from us, we will also collect a copy of your passport or driver's licence (to verify your identity), confirm whether you are an Australian resident and record the terms of your contract (including price), payment details, information relating to your financing arrangements (such as your bank details and how much money you are borrowing) and contact details for your authorised representatives (such as your lawyer);</li>
								<li>are a supplier - we will collect your name and contact details, details about the goods or services you supply and payment details;</li>
								<li>send us an enquiry, provide us feedback or otherwise get in touch with us - we may collect your name, contact details, details of your enquiry or feedback and information about our response;</li>

								<li>ask us to send you information about our services - we will collect your name, address, contact details, details of the properties you are interested in and how you heard about us or the relevant property development. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>2.2	SENSITIVE INFORMATION</h3>
							<p>Sensitive information is a subset of personal information that is generally afforded a higher level of privacy protection, such as health information.  We only collect sensitive information where it is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities and:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>the individual has consented; or</li>
								<li>we are required or authorised by or under law to do so.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>For example, if you purchase a property from us, we will collect information about your residency status, which may indicate your racial or ethnic origin.</p>
							<h3>2.3	COLLECTION OF INFORMATION OTHER THAN PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR WEBSITE</h3>
							<p>When you visit our website, some of the information that is collected about your visit is not personal information, as it does not reveal your identity. </p>
							<h5>SITE VISIT INFORMATION</h5>
							<p>For example, we record your server address, the date and time of your visit, the pages you visited, any documents you downloaded, the previous site you visited and the type of device, browser and operating system you used.</p>
							<p>We use and disclose this information in anonymous, aggregated form only, for purposes including statistical analysis and to assist us to improve the functionality and usability of our website. You are not individually identified, however we reserve the right to use or disclose this information to try to locate an individual where we reasonably believe that the individual may have engaged in any unlawful or inappropriate activity in connection with our website, or where we are otherwise required or authorised by law to do so.</p>
							<h5>COOKIES</h5>
							<p>A cookie is a small string of information that a website transfers to your browser for identification purposes. The cookies we use do not identify individual users, although they do identify the user's internet browser. </p>
							<p>We use cookies to hold anonymous session information.  This information is used to personalise your current visit to the website, for example to allow the website to remember who you are by keeping server variables linked to your session.</p>
							<p>We only use non-persistent cookies.  That is, they are held on your browser's memory only for the duration of your session.</p>
							<p>Most internet browsers are set to accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive them, you can adjust your internet browser to reject cookies, or to notify you when they are being used.  There are also software products available that can manage cookies for you.  Rejecting cookies can, however, limit the functionality of our website.</p>
